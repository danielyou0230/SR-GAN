# Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks (SRGAN)
## About this project
This project aims to implement SRGAN based on the Christian Ledig et al's "Photo-Realistic Single Image Super-Resolution Using a Generative Adversarial Network" (See: https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04802) with Tensorflow.  

In this project, we might incorporate the contents in Martin Arjovsky et al's "Wasserstein GAN" (See: https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07875) and Huikai Wu el al's "GP-GAN_Towards Realistic High-Resolution Image Blending" (See: https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07195) to achieve better performance or so.
