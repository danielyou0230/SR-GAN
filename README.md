# Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks (SRGAN)
## About this project
This project aims to implement SRGAN based on the Christian Ledig et al's "Photo-Realistic Single Image Super-Resolution Using a Generative Adversarial Network" (See: https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04802) with Tensorflow.  

In this project, we might incorporate the contents in Martin Arjovsky et al's "Wasserstein GAN" (See: https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07875) and Huikai Wu el al's "GP-GAN_Towards Realistic High-Resolution Image Blending" (See: https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07195) to achieve better performance or so.  

## Current Progress  
Implementing VGG19 (pending for verification)  
Implementing SRGAN (revising loss function from https://github.com/tadax/srgan )  

## Project Roadmap  
1. Implement VGG19  
2. Verify VGG19  
3. Implement SRGAN  
4. Verify SRGAN  
5. Train VGG19  
6. Train SRGAN  
7. Evaluate performance on SRGAN  

## Issues  
\#1. How to train VGG19 with Super-Resolution purpose?
